Hypothesis: Due to chagas disease having a gastrointestinal involving a paracite for of the disease the biodiversity of patients will be significanly lower than the gut microbiome of the control group.


Statistical methods:ANOVA


List of assumptions: The patients are from the same age group with similar diets. no other diseasses are found in any of the patients


Tests being performed: Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA, Zero-Inflated Poisson 


List of variables: Phylum of bacteria, genus of bacteria, abundance of bacteria in stool of control group, indeterminant, cardiac, and megacolon clinical forms of chagas disease


Response variables: phylum and genus of bacteria


Predictor variables: bacterial abundance of control group, indeterminant, cardiac, and megacolon clinical forms of chagas disease
